**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Before this project (unfotunately I didn't do the actual GPS session), I struggled with branching. It's been a rollercoaster of learning--all up to the last minute of working on this. 

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I think one of the biggest things that I still struggle with is merge conflict. I had a hard time resolving them, and of course--creating one when it was part of the assignment. I'm working on this stuff for hours, so if anything, I'm learning a ton by trial and error.
